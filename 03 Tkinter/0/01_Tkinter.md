Tkinter is the standard Python library used to create Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs). It provides Python bindings to the Tk
GUI toolkit and allows developers to build desktop applications with features like windows, buttons, menus, and other
widgets. Tkinter is included by default in most Python installations, making it easy to use for GUI programming across
different operating systems including Linux, Windows, and macOS.

To use Tkinter on Ubuntu, you need to ensure it is installed as it may not come pre-installed by default with Python. You can
install Tkinter on Ubuntu by running the command:

```
sudo apt-get install python3-tk
```

This installs the Tkinter package for Python 3 and the necessary Tcl/Tk libraries required for building GUI applications with
Tkinter on Ubuntu. After installation, you can import Tkinter in your Python scripts using `import tkinter` and start
creating GUI applications.

Tkinter supports event-driven programming and provides various layout management and widget customization options, making it
suitable for rapid GUI application development on Ubuntu or other platforms.
