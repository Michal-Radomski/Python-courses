To install a Python package from pypi.org and run it in a file in an empty directory, follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal/command prompt and navigate to your empty directory.

2. Install the package using pip (Python's package installer). For example, to install a package called "package_name", run:

```
pip install package_name
```

If you have multiple Python versions or pip is not recognized, try:

```
python -m pip install package_name
```

3. After installation, create a Python file in the same directory, for example `script.py`.

4. Inside `script.py`, import the package with:

```python
import package_name
```

5. Write code using the package as needed. For example:

```python
import package_name

print(package_name.__version__)  # Or any usage
```

6. Run the Python script from the command line:

```
python script.py
```

This will execute the script and use the installed package.

Summary:

- Use `pip install package_name` to install the package.
- Import it in your Python file.
- Run the file with `python filename.py`.

Make sure Python and pip are correctly installed and added to your system PATH. This method works in any empty directory
since pip installs the package into your Python environment globally or in a virtual environment if activated.

If you want to isolate packages, consider creating a virtual environment with:

```
python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate  # On Unix/macOS
env\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
pip install package_name
```

Then run your script within that environment.

This approach ensures the package is installed from pypi.org and can be used immediately in your project files.[1][2][5]

The "error: externally-managed-environment" occurs because your Python environment is controlled by an external package
manager (like your OS's package system) that restricts pip from installing packages system-wide to avoid breaking the system
Python or managed packages.

To resolve this and properly install Python packages, you should use a virtual environment. A virtual environment is an
isolated Python environment that allows you to install and manage packages separately from the system Python. Here's how to
do it step-by-step:

1. Create a virtual environment in your empty directory:

```
python3 -m venv venv
```

This creates a folder named `venv` containing the isolated Python environment.

2. Activate the virtual environment:

- On Linux/macOS:

```
source venv/bin/activate
```

- On Windows:

```
venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. With the virtual environment activated, install your desired package using pip:

```
pip install package_name
```

4. Create your Python script file (e.g., `script.py`) in the same directory.

5. In `script.py`, import and use the installed package:

```python
import package_name
# Use package functions here
```

6. Run your Python script while the virtual environment is active:

```
python script.py
```

This approach bypasses the system-managed environment and allows safe package installation and usage without risking your
system Python. When done, you can deactivate the virtual environment by running `deactivate`.

Alternatively, if you want to install system-wide package via OS package manager (for Debian/Ubuntu) you can try:

```
sudo apt install python3-xyz
```

where `xyz` is the package name.

Using `pipx` is another option for installing standalone Python applications with virtual environments managed automatically.

Do not use pip with the `--break-system-packages` option unless you understand the risks of potentially breaking your system
Python environment.

References to details on this issue and solutions are explained in PEP 668 and multiple community guides.[1][3][4][5]

To deactivate a Python virtual environment, simply type the command:

```
deactivate
```

and press Enter in the terminal where the virtual environment is currently active. This works the same on all operating
systems (Windows, macOS, Linux). After running this command, your shell will return to the normal system Python environment,
and the virtual environment's name will no longer appear in your prompt.[1][3][7]

This command is the proper way to exit the isolated environment created by `python -m venv` or `virtualenv`.

You can either deactivate the Python virtual environment by typing the command:

```
deactivate
```

in the active terminal session, which returns you to your system’s normal Python environment.

Alternatively, closing the terminal window or tab where the virtual environment is active will also end the session and
effectively "deactivate" it, because the environment is only active in that specific shell session. When you open a new
terminal afterward, the virtual environment will no longer be active.

In summary:

- Use the `deactivate` command to leave the virtual environment while keeping the terminal open.
- Or just close the terminal to exit the environment as part of ending the session.

Both methods are acceptable, and closing the terminal is a quick way to leave the environment if you don't need the current
shell session anymore.[1][2][3]

Yes, you can delete the `venv` directory just like you would delete the `node_modules` folder in JavaScript projects to
remove the virtual environment entirely. This deletes all installed packages and the isolated Python environment set up
inside that folder. Just make sure the virtual environment is deactivated before deleting it. For example:

- On Unix-like systems (Linux, macOS):

```bash
deactivate
rm -rf venv
```

- On Windows (Command Prompt or Powershell):

```powershell
deactivate
rmdir /s /q venv
```

Regarding the equivalent of `package.json` in Python projects: Python uses different files for managing dependencies and
project metadata.

- The closest equivalent is usually `requirements.txt`, which is a plain text file listing all Python packages your project
  depends on. You use:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

to install them.

- More modern Python projects use `pyproject.toml`, which manages dependencies and build-system requirements in a
  standardized way, similar in spirit to `package.json`.

- Tools like Poetry use `pyproject.toml` as the central config file to manage packages, lock versions, and metadata for the
  project.

In summary:

| Concept              | JavaScript (Node.js) | Python                                          |
| -------------------- | -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Package folder       | node_modules         | venv (virtual environment folder)               |
| Package manifest     | package.json         | requirements.txt, pyproject.toml                |
| Install dependencies | npm install          | pip install -r requirements.txt, poetry install |

So yes, delete `venv` if you want to remove the environment. And use `requirements.txt` or `pyproject.toml` to manage
dependencies like `package.json` does in Node.js.[1][2][7][8]

The error "Could not open requirements file: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'requirements.txt'" means that the file
`requirements.txt` does not exist in your current directory, so pip cannot find it to install packages from it.

To fix this:

1. Create a `requirements.txt` file manually in your project directory (the parent folder where your Python script and
   virtual environment reside). This file should contain each package you want to install, with optional version numbers,
   e.g.:

```
requests==2.31.0
numpy>=1.25.0
```

2. Save the file in your project root folder (not inside the `venv` folder).

3. Then run:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

in the same folder where the file is located.

If you don't have a `requirements.txt` yet but already installed packages in your virtual environment, you can generate the
file by running:

```
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```

This will list all installed packages and their exact versions into `requirements.txt` for future use.

Summary:

- `requirements.txt` file is a manual or auto-generated list of your project dependencies.
- It should live in the project folder (not in `venv`).
- Pip uses it to install the same packages with `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

This way, you avoid the error by making sure pip sees the correct requirements file in the current directory before
installing.[1][2][3][6]
