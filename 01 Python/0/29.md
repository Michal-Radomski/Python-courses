### Higher-Order Function

A **higher-order function** is a function that either:

1. Takes one or more functions as arguments.
2. Returns a function as a result.

In other words, it operates on other functions by either accepting them as input or returning them as output.

#### Example in Python:

```python
# Higher-order function that takes another function as argument
def apply_function(func, value):
    return func(value)

# A simple function to be passed to the higher-order function
def square(x):
    return x * x

result = apply_function(square, 5)  # Pass 'square' function as argument
print(result)  # Output: 25
```

In this example, `apply_function` is a higher-order function because it takes the `square` function as an argument and
applies it to a value.

#### Example in TypeScript:

```typescript
// Higher-order function that takes another function as argument
function applyFunction(func: (x: number) => number, value: number): number {
  return func(value);
}

// A simple function to be passed to the higher-order function
const square = (x: number): number => x * x;

const result = applyFunction(square, 5); // Pass 'square' function as argument
console.log(result); // Output: 25
```

In this TypeScript example, `applyFunction` is a higher-order function because it takes a function (`square`) as an argument
and returns the result of calling it on `value`.

### Compound Function

A **compound function** is a function that combines multiple functions to create a new function. This typically involves
composing functions, where the output of one function becomes the input to another.

For example, function composition is where you chain multiple functions together.

#### Example in Python (using function composition):

```python
# Function that combines two functions into one
def compose(f, g):
    return lambda x: f(g(x))

# Functions to be composed
def add2(x):
    return x + 2

def multiply3(x):
    return x * 3

# Composing add2 and multiply3 (add2 after multiply3)
result = compose(add2, multiply3)(5)  # First multiply by 3, then add 2
print(result)  # Output: 17 (5 * 3 = 15, 15 + 2 = 17)
```

Here, `compose` is a compound function that takes two functions (`add2` and `multiply3`) and returns a new function that
applies them in a specific order.

#### Example in TypeScript (using function composition):

```typescript
// Function that combines two functions into one
function compose<T>(f: (x: T) => T, g: (x: T) => T): (x: T) => T {
  return (x: T) => f(g(x));
}

// Functions to be composed
const add2 = (x: number): number => x + 2;
const multiply3 = (x: number): number => x * 3;

// Composing add2 and multiply3 (add2 after multiply3)
const result = compose(add2, multiply3)(5); // First multiply by 3, then add 2
console.log(result); // Output: 17 (5 * 3 = 15, 15 + 2 = 17)
```

In this TypeScript example, `compose` is used to create a new function that applies `multiply3` first, then applies `add2` to
the result.

### Summary:

- **Higher-order function**: A function that takes another function as an argument or returns a function.
- **Compound function**: A function that combines two or more functions, often by function composition.

Both higher-order functions and compound functions are common in functional programming paradigms and are used extensively in
modern JavaScript/TypeScript and Python for code modularity and reusability.
