### Summary

Python and JS/TS share many language concepts despite syntax differences. Both support conditionals, loops, functions,
classes, exception handling, modules, async programming, and generators, though the exact keywords differ or have slightly
different syntaxes.

Python's keyword list is smaller and more specialized towards readability, while JS/TS have some more complex syntax forms,
especially for functions and modules.

This table covers the majority of frequently used keywords and their closest JS/TS equivalents.[1][2][10]
