Here is a comparison of how Python, JavaScript/TypeScript, and Bash check the comparison `"a" > "A"`:

## Python

- Python compares strings lexicographically using Unicode code points via the `ord()` function.
- `"a"` has Unicode code point 97; `"A"` has 65. Since 97 > 65, `"a" > "A"` evaluates to `True`.
- Comparison is case-sensitive by default.
- Example: `print("a" > "A") # True`

## JavaScript/TypeScript

- JavaScript/TypeScript also compares strings lexicographically based on UTF-16 code units.
- The comparison `"a" > "A"` uses character Unicode values: `"a"` (code unit 97) vs `"A"` (65), so result is `true`.
- Comparison is case-sensitive by default.
- Example: `console.log("a" > "A"); // true`

## Bash

- Bash string comparison is usually done with `[ "$a" \> "$b" ]` or `[[ "$a" > "$b" ]]`.
- This comparison is lexicographic based on ASCII values of characters, so `"a" > "A"` is `true` because ASCII 'a' (97) > 'A'
  (65).
- However, Bash does not use Unicode by default, so extended characters may behave differently.
- Case-insensitive comparisons require extra steps like converting both strings to lowercase via `${var,,}` or using regular
  expressions with `shopt -s nocasematch`.
- Example:
  ```bash
  a="a"
  b="A"
  if [[ "$a" > "$b" ]]; then
    echo "true"
  else
    echo "false"
  fi
  ```

| Language              | Comparison Method            | Case Sensitivity            | Example Result for `"a" > "A"` |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------- | --------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Python                | Unicode code point lex order | Case-sensitive              | `True`                         |
| JavaScript/TypeScript | UTF-16 lex order             | Case-sensitive              | `true`                         |
| Bash                  | ASCII lex order              | Case-sensitive (by default) | `true`                         |

In summary, all three use lexicographic comparison based on character code values (Unicode in Python/JS, ASCII in Bash by
default), which leads to `"a" > "A"` being true because lowercase 'a' has a higher code point than uppercase
'A'.[1][3][4][5][8]
