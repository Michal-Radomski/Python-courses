In JavaScript, the keys in an object can be:

- **Strings** (the most common and default key type)
- **Symbols** (a unique and immutable primitive type introduced in ES6)

Keys are always converted to strings if they are not symbols. For example, if you use a number as a key, it is coerced to a
string internally.

Example in JavaScript:

```javascript
const obj = {
  name: "value", // string key
  42: "number key", // coerced to string "42"
  [Symbol("id")]: "id", // symbol key
};
```

In TypeScript, keys follow the same rules as JavaScript.

In Python, keys in a dictionary can be:

- **Any immutable data type**, typically:
  - Strings
  - Numbers (int, float)
  - Tuples (if all elements are immutable)
  - Other immutable types (e.g., frozenset)
- Keys must be hashable (implement `__hash__()` method) and comparable (implement `__eq__()` method).

Example in Python:

```python
d = {
  "name": "value",          # string key
  42: "number key",         # int key
  (1, 2): "tuple key"       # tuple key
}
```

### Summary table

| Language   | Allowed Key Types                 | Notes                                               |
| ---------- | --------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| JavaScript | Strings, Symbols                  | Numbers coerced to strings; symbols are unique keys |
| Python     | Any immutable and hashable object | Includes strings, numbers, tuples; must be hashable |

Thus, JavaScript object keys are more limited (strings or symbols), while Python dict keys can be more flexible in type, as
long as they are immutable and hashable.[2][6][8]
