The difference between `==` and `is` in Python is:

- `==` (Equality Operator) checks whether the **values** of two objects are equal. It compares the contents of the objects,
  regardless of whether they are the exact same object in memory.
- `is` (Identity Operator) checks whether two variables point to the **exact same object** in memory (i.e., have the same
  identity).

Example:

```python
a = [1, 2, 3]
b = [1, 2, 3]
c = a

print(a == b)  # True, because values are equal
print(a is b)  # False, they are different objects in memory
print(a is c)  # True, both refer to the same object
```

In practical terms:

- Use `==` when you want to check if two objects have the same content.
- Use `is` when you want to check if two references point to the same object (useful for singleton checks like `None`).

This distinction is crucial to avoid subtle bugs in Python code related to object identity versus equality.[1][2][3][6]

In summary:

- `==` → equality comparison of values
- `is` → identity comparison of objects in memory
