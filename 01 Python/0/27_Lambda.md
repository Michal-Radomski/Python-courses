The equivalent of Python's lambda function in JavaScript/TypeScript is the arrow function, introduced in ES6.

- Both Python lambda and JS arrow functions are anonymous, concise functions primarily used for short, single-expression
  operations.
- Python lambdas use the syntax `lambda args: expression` and implicitly return the expression's value.
- JavaScript arrow functions use the syntax `(args) => expression` or `arg => expression` for a single argument, which
  implicitly returns the expression as well.

Example comparison:

Python lambda:

```python
add = lambda x, y: x + y
print(add(3, 5))  # Output: 8
```

JavaScript arrow function:

```js
const add = (x, y) => x + y;
console.log(add(3, 5)); // Output: 8
```

Arrow functions provide a very similar mechanism to Python lambdas, enabling inline anonymous function definitions in a
clean, readable way without the `function` keyword. They are commonly used with array methods like `map`, `filter`, and
`reduce`.

In summary, the arrow function in JavaScript/TypeScript serves as the direct and practical equivalent to Python's lambda
function.[1][2][7]
