Python comprehensions (like list comprehensions) do not have a direct syntactic equivalent in JavaScript/TypeScript, but
similar functionality is achieved with built-in array methods such as `map()` and `filter()`.

- Python list comprehension combines mapping and filtering in a single concise expression:
  ```python
  [x**2 for x in numbers if x % 2 == 0]
  ```
- In JS/TS, you replicate this by chaining `.filter()` and `.map()`:
  ```js
  const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6];
  const evenSquares = numbers.filter((x) => x % 2 === 0).map((x) => x ** 2);
  ```
- This approach is widely used and idiomatic in modern JS/TS, providing a clean functional style similar to Python
  comprehensions.
- There was an experimental "array comprehension" syntax proposed for JavaScript, similar to Python's syntax, but it was
  never widely adopted or standardized and is mostly unsupported in browsers.
- So while JS/TS lack dedicated comprehension syntax, `map` and `filter` chaining is the practical equivalent, expressive and
  clear.

Summary: | Feature | Python | JavaScript/TypeScript |
|-----------------------|------------------------|--------------------------------------------| | Comprehensions form |
`[expr for item in list if cond]` | `list.filter(cond).map(expr)` (method chaining) | | Syntax sugar | Yes, native
comprehension syntax | No native syntax, use functional methods | | Common idiomatic usage| Yes | Yes, with `map()` and
`filter()` |

This combination replicates all common comprehension use cases in a few lines of readable code.[1][3][5][7]
