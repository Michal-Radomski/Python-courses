Here is a list of the most common built-in exceptions in Python, along with brief descriptions:

- **ArithmeticError**: Base class for arithmetic errors.
- **AssertionError**: Raised when an assert statement fails.
- **AttributeError**: Raised when attribute reference or assignment fails.
- **EOFError**: Raised when `input()` hits an end-of-file condition.
- **ImportError**: Raised when an import statement fails.
- **IndexError**: Raised when a sequence index is out of range.
- **KeyError**: Raised when a dictionary key is not found.
- **KeyboardInterrupt**: Raised when the user interrupts program execution (e.g., Ctrl+C).
- **MemoryError**: Raised when an operation runs out of memory.
- **NameError**: Raised when a local or global name is not found.
- **NotImplementedError**: Raised when an abstract method requires an overriding method.
- **OSError**: Raised for system-related errors (e.g., file not found, permission denied).
- **OverflowError**: Raised when a numeric calculation exceeds limits.
- **ReferenceError**: Raised when a weak reference proxy is used to access a garbage-collected object.
- **RuntimeError**: Raised for errors detected that don’t fall into other categories.
- **StopIteration**: Raised to signal the end of an iterator.
- **SyntaxError**: Raised for syntax errors.
- **IndentationError**: A subtype of SyntaxError for indentation issues.
- **TypeError**: Raised when an operation or function is applied to an object of inappropriate type.
- **ValueError**: Raised when an operation receives an argument of the right type but inappropriate value.
- **ZeroDivisionError**: Raised when division or modulo by zero is attempted.
- **FileNotFoundError**: Raised when a file or directory is requested but doesn’t exist.
- **ModuleNotFoundError**: Raised when a module could not be found during import.
- **SystemExit**: Raised by the `sys.exit()` function to exit a program.

This list represents frequently encountered exceptions in everyday Python programming and can be caught or raised to handle
error situations effectively.[1][2][3][4][5]
