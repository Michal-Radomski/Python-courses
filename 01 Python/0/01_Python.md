Python is a popular, high-level programming language created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991. It is known for
its simple, readable syntax that resembles the English language, making it beginner-friendly and easy to write and maintain.
Python supports multiple programming paradigms, including procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming.

Python is widely used for various applications such as web development (server-side), software development, mathematics,
system scripting, data science, automation, artificial intelligence, and more. It works on multiple platforms like Windows,
Mac, Linux, and Raspberry Pi.

One of Python’s strengths is its extensive standard library and vast ecosystem of third-party libraries and frameworks, which
accelerates development by reducing the need to write code from scratch. Python supports rapid prototyping due to its
interpreter system, allowing code execution as soon as it is written.

In terms of syntax, Python relies heavily on indentation (whitespace) to define code blocks such as loops, functions, and
classes, unlike many other languages that use curly braces or semicolons. For example, a simple Python program to print
"Hello, World!" is:

```python
print("Hello, World!")
```

Overall, Python is praised for its readability, versatility, ease of learning, and strong community support, making it a top
choice for beginners and professionals alike.[1][3][7]
