The line `# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-` is called an encoding declaration in a Python source file. It tells the Python interpreter
that the text in the file is encoded using UTF-8. This declaration is important when a file contains non-ASCII characters
(such as accented letters or other Unicode symbols) in the source code, including comments or string literals. Without this
declaration, Python 2 and some older tools may assume ASCII encoding by default, which can lead to errors when encountering
non-ASCII characters.

In summary:

- The declaration appears as a special comment at the very top of the Python file.
- It specifies the encoding used to represent the text in the source file.
- UTF-8 is a common encoding that supports a wide range of characters worldwide.
- This is mainly important for Python 2 or for editors and tools that need to know the file encoding.
- In Python 3, UTF-8 is the default encoding, so this declaration is often optional but may still be included for clarity or
  compatibility.

This mechanism is defined in PEP 263, which standardizes how to declare source file encodings in Python.[1][6][7]
