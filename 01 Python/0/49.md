The **pycache** directory is created by Python to store compiled bytecode (.pyc files) of imported modules, which speeds up
program execution by avoiding recompilation each time the module is used. However, this directory is only generated when a
Python file is imported as a module, not when a script is run directly from the command line. Thus, some Python files produce
**pycache** because they are imported, while others do not because they are executed directly as scripts without being
imported.

Key reasons for the behavior:

- When you import a module, Python compiles it to bytecode and saves it in **pycache** for future use.
- When running a script directly (e.g., python script.py), Python executes the script without creating **pycache**.
- This behavior helps improve performance and keeps source directories cleaner by segregating bytecode.

In summary, **pycache** appears for imported modules, not for scripts run directly, which explains why some Python files
produce this directory and some do not.[1][3][4][9]
