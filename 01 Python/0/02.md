The main differences between Python 2 and Python 3 are substantial and affect syntax, string handling, performance, and
compatibility.

### Syntax and Readability

- Python 2 uses the print statement without parentheses: `print "Hello"`; Python 3 uses the print function with parentheses:
  `print("Hello")`.
- Integer division in Python 2 truncates to integer: `5 / 2 == 2`; in Python 3 it performs true division returning float:
  `5 / 2 == 2.5`, with `//` for integer division.
- Exception handling syntax changed: Python 2 uses `except IOError, e:`, Python 3 uses `except IOError as e:` for clarity.
- Python 3 removed ambiguous tuple comparison behavior present in Python 2.
- Python 3 requires parentheses in the `raise` statement when including exception arguments.

### String Handling

- Python 2 strings are ASCII by default with separate Unicode string type (`u"..."`), while Python 3 strings are Unicode by
  default.
- Python 3 differentiates between text (str) and binary data (bytes), preventing mixing errors common in Python 2.

### Performance and Memory Usage

- Python 3 has improved memory management and garbage collection, leading to better efficiency in long-running applications.
- Python 3 contains optimizations for speed, especially with modern features like `lru_cache` and `asyncio`.
- Python 2 may be slightly faster in some legacy numeric computations due to less strict type enforcement, but Python 3’s
  improvements usually outweigh this.

### Compatibility and Support

- Python 3 is the actively supported and developed version with access to the latest libraries and features.
- Python 2 is no longer maintained (official support ended in 2020), so Python 3 is recommended for all new projects.
- Transitioning from Python 2 to 3 requires code changes due to incompatibilities in syntax and behavior.

In essence, Python 3 modernizes the language for better readability, Unicode support, and performance, making it the
preferred version for current and future development, while Python 2 remains relevant mainly for legacy systems.[1][2][3]
