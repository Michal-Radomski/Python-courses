The difference between http://localhost and http://127.0.0.1 is mainly in how they are resolved by your computer, though both
refer to your own local machine (loopback address).

- localhost is a hostname that normally resolves to the IP address 127.0.0.1 through a DNS lookup or hosts file. This means
  when you enter localhost, your system looks up its IP address before connecting.
- 127.0.0.1 is the actual IPv4 loopback IP address that directly points to your own machine without needing any hostname
  resolution.
- Because localhost needs resolution, accessing 127.0.0.1 can be slightly faster, bypassing DNS lookup.
- localhost can sometimes be configured to point to other addresses or also resolve to IPv6 loopback (::1), while 127.0.0.1
  specifically refers to the IPv4 loopback address.
- Both ultimately go to the same local device and serve the same purpose for development or testing by accessing local
  servers.

In summary, http://localhost and http://127.0.0.1 typically access the same place but use different methods for address
resolution, with 127.0.0.1 being the raw IP address and localhost being a hostname that resolves to it.[1][2][3]
