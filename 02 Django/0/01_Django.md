Django is a high-level, free, and open-source web framework for Python that enables rapid and efficient development of
secure, maintainable, and scalable websites. It follows the model-template-view architectural pattern and emphasizes
reusability, less code, and the principle of "Don't Repeat Yourself" (DRY). Django includes many built-in features such as an
ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) that allows database operations with Python objects, an automatic admin interface for
database management, and tools for handling common web development tasks like user authentication and CRUD operations. It is
especially suitable for database-driven websites and helps developers focus on writing application logic rather than
reinventing basic web functionalities. Django is widely used by well-known websites and supported by a strong developer
community.[1][3][4][5][6][7][8]
