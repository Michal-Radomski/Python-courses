The SECRET_KEY in Django's settings.py is a critical security component used for cryptographic signing. It protects your
application by providing cryptographic signatures for session data, CSRF tokens, password reset tokens, and other sensitive
operations. This key ensures integrity and confidentiality, preventing attackers from forging session cookies, tampering with
data, or compromising users' information.

Because the SECRET_KEY is a secret cryptographic key, it should never be committed to a public repository like GitHub.
Exposing this key publicly can allow attackers to exploit your application’s security mechanisms, impersonate users, or gain
unauthorized access. Instead, a common best practice is to keep the SECRET_KEY outside version control, such as in
environment variables or external configuration files loaded at runtime, thereby keeping it secret and safe.

In summary:

- SECRET_KEY is essential for security operations in Django.
- It must be kept secret and never exposed publicly.
- Do not commit it to GitHub or other public repos.
- Use environment variables or secret management solutions to store it safely.

This approach helps maintain the security and integrity of your Django application.[1][2][3][5]
