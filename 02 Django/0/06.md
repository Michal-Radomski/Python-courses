In Python, lists are ordered collections where the order of elements is preserved and indexed. Dictionaries in Python have
been ordered since Python 3.7, meaning they maintain the insertion order of keys. Before Python 3.7, dictionaries were
unordered, but now when iterating over a dictionary, elements appear in the order they were added.

In JavaScript and TypeScript, arrays are ordered collections, preserving the sequence of elements by their index. Objects in
JavaScript and TypeScript are collections of key-value pairs that are generally ordered as well — since ES2015, the insertion
order of string and symbol keys is preserved in objects, although this ordering is not identical to arrays' strict order and
may have some nuanced rules regarding integer-like keys.

Hence both Python lists and dictionaries (3.7+) and JavaScript/TypeScript arrays and objects maintain an order, but lists and
arrays are inherently ordered sequences, while dictionaries and objects maintain insertion order of keys but are primarily
key-value mappings rather than sequences.[1][2][4][9]
