The message "You have 18 unapplied migration(s). Your project may not work properly until you apply the migrations for
app(s): admin, auth, contenttypes, sessions. Run 'python manage.py migrate' to apply them." means that your Django project
has database schema changes defined in migration files that have not yet been applied to your database. These migrations are
important because they create or update the necessary database tables for core Django apps such as admin, authentication,
contenttypes, and session management. Until you apply these migrations by running the command `python manage.py migrate`,
your project may encounter errors or not function correctly due to missing database structures.

In summary:

- "Unapplied migrations" are changes to the database schema that have been defined but not yet executed on your database.
- These migrations typically come from Django's built-in apps like admin and auth which require certain tables to function.
- Running `python manage.py migrate` applies these migrations by creating or updating database tables accordingly, ensuring
  your project works as expected.

This is a standard and necessary step when setting up or maintaining a Django project to keep the database schema
synchronized with your models and Django's internal apps.[1][2][3]
